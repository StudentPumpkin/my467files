    <h3>Example of Writing HTML</h3>
    <p>Writing HTML is fiarly straight-forward to me because:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I've written and editted XML and HTML since 2017</li>
      <li>Tags are easy to under stand once you get the hang of them</li>
      <li>Once you troubleshoot XML conversions for years, HTML is easy</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are 2 things I dislike the most though, they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>DEFINITION LISTS</b> - they are evil, especially when you are converting them from one format to another</li>
      <li><i>Tables</i> - also evil, but easier to troubleshoot than definition lists</li>
    </ul>
